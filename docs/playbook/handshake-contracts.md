# Handshake Contracts

Handshake contracts spell out how two groups promise to work together before policy catches up. <a href="#when-to-draft-one" data-primary-action>Draft your handshake contract</a> or <a href="../runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>.

## When to draft one

- A stream depends on another team to hit a shared milestone.
